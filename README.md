# python-math-test
Automated math quiz written in python. Questions are randomized so that the script may be reused without running problems into the ground.

## Beginning the quiz
Place this script in your working directory and run `python mathquiz.py` from your command-line. The quiz is initialized to choose two random numbers from 0.1 to 10 and a random operation (from **addition**, **subtraction**, **multiplication**, **division**). To adjust the difficulty of the quiz, make changes to lines 6 & 7 (by adding more decimals or expanding the random number range).

## Bugs
The current version of the quiz is returning **"Incorrect :("** for correct (and incorrect) answers.
